# Multimodal-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

BraTS has always been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans. BraTS 2020 utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative MRI scans and primarily focuses on the segmentation (Task 1) of intrinsically heterogeneous 
(in appearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas. Furthemore, to pinpoint the clinical relevance of this segmentation task, 
BraTSâ€™20 also focuses on the prediction of patient overall survival (Task 2), and the distinction between pseudoprogression and true tumor recurrence (Task 3), 
via integrative analyses of radiomic features and machine learning algorithms.
Finally, BraTS'20 intends to evaluate the algorithmic uncertainty in tumor segmentation (Task 4).
